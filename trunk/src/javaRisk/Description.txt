Risk is a turn-based board game for 2 or more players.
The game board is a predefined grid of territories. 
At the beginning of the game, each territory is randomly assigned to a player
and a random-sized army is put onto it.
During a player's turn, he may launch an attack from a territory he controls
to an adjacent territory. The outcome of the territory is determined
by rolling dice. The attacking territory rolls one fewer dice than the number
of armies on that territory. The defending territory rolls the same number of
dice as armies on that territory. The territory that rolls a higher number
wins the battle. In the event of a tie, the defending territory wins the 
battle. If the attack is successful, the attacker gains control of the
defending territory, and all but one of the armies from the attacking territory
are moved into it. If the attack is unsuccessful, all but one of the armies of
the attacking territory are lost.
A player may choose to end his turn at any time. Once a player ends his turn,
his territories are randomly fortified. Fortification involves the addition of
one army per two territories the player controls.
The game is over once one player controls the entire world map, and that player
is the winner.
