Compiling and running the Risk game is very simple.
To compile the program, simply copy all the java source files into a folder
called javaRisk, and run the following command:

javac *.java

Note that Risk requires at least Java 1.5.0 be installed. Previous versions
of Java are not supported.

To run the server, simply run the following command:

java RiskServer

No command line arguments are necessary, and any provided will be ignored.
The server always runs on port 1988.

To run a client, simply run the following command:

java RiskClient

No command line arguments are necessary, and any provided will be ignored.
The client will always attempt to run on port 1988.
Once the client is running, dialog boxes ask for your username, the host name,
and the game to connect to before displaying the GUI.
